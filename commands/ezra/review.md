description: "Dynamic multi-agent code review. Recommends optimal agents from 100 roles for reviewing staged changes, files, or commits. Usage: /ezra:review [scope] [--agents N] [--preset name] [--classic]."
---

You are running an EZRA multi-agent code review.

If `.ezra/` does not exist, tell the user to run `/ezra:init` first and stop.

## Determine Scope

If $ARGUMENTS contains a file path → review that file
If $ARGUMENTS contains "staged" or "changes" → review staged git changes
If $ARGUMENTS contains a commit hash → review that commit
If no scope specified → review staged changes, or if none, the last commit

```bash
# Determine what to review
git diff --cached --name-only  # staged
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only    # last commit
```

## Agent Selection

Read the agent registry from `agents/registry.yaml` (or `~/.claude/agents/registry.yaml`).

Parse modifiers from $ARGUMENTS:
- `--classic` → Use original 3-agent review (architecture + security + quality)
- `--preset <name>` → Use a registry preset
- `--agents <count>` → Deploy N agents (auto-recommend based on changed files)
- `--roles <id1,id2,...>` → Deploy specific roles
- (no modifier) → **Smart selection** (below)

### Smart Agent Selection (default)

Analyze the files being reviewed to auto-recommend agents:

1. **Detect file types** in the diff:
   - `.ts/.tsx/.jsx` frontend files → recommend `fe-react`, `a11y-wcag`
   - `.ts` service/controller files → recommend `arch-general`, `sec-api`
   - `.prisma` or migration files → recommend `data-schema`, `data-migration`
   - `Dockerfile`, `terraform`, CI configs → recommend `devops-docker`, `devops-cicd`
   - `.test.ts`, `.spec.ts` → recommend `test-unit`, `test-coverage`
   - Auth-related files → recommend `sec-auth`, `sec-crypto`

2. **Count files changed**:
   - 1-3 files → 3 agents (quick review)
   - 4-10 files → 4-6 agents
   - 10+ files → 6-8 agents

3. **Present recommendation**:

EZRA REVIEW — AGENT SELECTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Reviewing: <N> files (<scope description>)

Detected: <file type analysis summary>

📊 Recommended: <N> agents

  #  Agent                    Domain        Why

```

If user says "customize", show full domain/role list for selection.

### Dynamic Agent Dispatch

For each selected role:
1. Look up `base_agent` in registry
2. Construct brief:

   "You are operating as the EZRA {role.name} ({role.id}).
   Your specialty: {role.specialty}
   
   Review these changed files: <list of files with diff content>
   
   Focus your review on: {role.best_for}
   The review team includes: {all role names}
   Do not duplicate findings from other reviewers.
   
   Rate each finding: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW with confidence score (0-100).
   Output structured YAML."

3. Dispatch using the base_agent engine
4. Collect results

---

## Classic Review (with --classic flag)

### Agent 1: Architecture Review (ezra-architect)

Brief: "Review these changed files for architectural compliance:
<list of files>

Check against the project's established patterns documented in .ezra/knowledge.yaml.
Look for:
1. Layer violations (e.g., controller calling repository directly, bypassing service layer)
2. Circular dependencies introduced
3. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., using callbacks in one place, promises elsewhere)
4. Missing abstractions or leaky abstractions
5. Coupling that should be loose

Rate each finding: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
Output structured YAML."

### Agent 2: Security Review (ezra-reviewer)

Brief: "Perform a security-focused review of these changed files:
<list of files with diff content>

Check for OWASP Top 10 2025 risks:
1. Injection (SQL, NoSQL, command, LDAP)
2. Broken authentication / session management
3. Sensitive data exposure (logging PII, hardcoded secrets, missing encryption)
4. XML/JSON external entities
5. Broken access control (missing auth checks, IDOR)
6. Security misconfiguration
7. XSS (stored, reflected, DOM)
8. Insecure deserialization
9. Using components with known vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient logging and monitoring

Also check:
- Input validation completeness
- Output encoding
- Error handling (information leakage in error messages)
- Race conditions
- Path traversal

Rate each finding: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW with confidence score (0-100).
Output structured YAML."

### Agent 3: Quality Review (ezra-reviewer)

Brief: "Perform a code quality review of these changed files:
<list of files with diff content>

Check for:
1. Type safety: any types, missing return types, unsafe casts
2. Error handling: uncaught promises, generic catch blocks, swallowed errors
3. Testing: are there corresponding test updates for the changes?
4. Naming: clear, consistent, domain-appropriate naming
5. Complexity: functions too long (>50 lines), deeply nested logic (>3 levels)
6. DRY violations: duplicated logic that should be abstracted
7. Dead code: unused imports, unreachable branches, commented-out code
8. Documentation: missing JSDoc/docstrings on public APIs
9. Edge cases: null/undefined handling, empty arrays, boundary conditions
10. Performance: N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization

Rate each finding: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
Output structured YAML."

## Aggregate Results

Combine all three agent outputs. Deduplicate findings that overlap (e.g., a security issue that is also a quality issue).

## Check Against Decisions

Cross-reference findings with `.ezra/decisions/` — if any finding contradicts an active decision, escalate it to CRITICAL regardless of the agent's original severity.

## Present Report

```
EZRA CODE REVIEW
═══════════════════════════════════════════
Scope: <what was reviewed>
Files: <count>

FINDINGS BY SEVERITY:
  🔴 Critical: <count>
  🟠 High:     <count>
  🟡 Medium:   <count>
  🔵 Low:      <count>

ARCHITECTURE:
  <list findings with file:line, severity, description>

SECURITY:
  <list findings with file:line, severity, description, confidence>

QUALITY:
  <list findings with file:line, severity, description>

DECISION CONFLICTS:
  <any findings that conflict with recorded decisions>

VERDICT: <APPROVE / APPROVE WITH NOTES / REQUEST CHANGES / BLOCK>

Recommended Actions:
  1. <most critical action>
  2. <next action>
  3. <next action>
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

Verdict logic:
- Any CRITICAL finding → BLOCK
- 3+ HIGH findings → REQUEST CHANGES
- HIGH findings with confidence > 80 → REQUEST CHANGES
- Only MEDIUM/LOW → APPROVE WITH NOTES
- No findings → APPROVE

Execute all phases automatically without asking for confirmation.
