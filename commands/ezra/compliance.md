# EZRA Compliance — Profile Manager

You are managing compliance profiles. Profiles map to predefined sets of standards and security rules that get merged into EZRA settings when activated.

## Subcommands

Parse the user input to determine which subcommand they want. If no subcommand is given, default to listing profiles.

### list (default)

Display all available compliance profiles with activation status:

```
EZRA COMPLIANCE PROFILES
========================================
Profile         Status      Rules
----------------------------------------
iso-25010       inactive    24 rules
owasp-2025      inactive    10 rules
soc2            inactive    15 rules
hipaa           inactive    12 rules
pci-dss         inactive    14 rules
gdpr            inactive    11 rules
wcag-aa         inactive     8 rules
========================================
Active: 0 of 7 profiles
```

### activate <profile>

Activate a compliance profile:

1. Validate the profile name exists
2. Load current settings
3. Merge the profile rules into standards and security custom_rules
4. Mark the profile as active in .ezra/compliance-state.yaml
5. Write updated settings
6. Confirm activation with list of added rules

### deactivate <profile>

Deactivate a compliance profile:

1. Validate the profile is currently active
2. Load current settings
3. Remove the profile rules from standards and security custom_rules
4. Mark the profile as inactive in .ezra/compliance-state.yaml
5. Write updated settings
6. Confirm deactivation

### check

Run compliance check against active profiles:

1. Load all active profiles
2. For each profile, verify all required rules are present in settings
3. Check if any required rules have been overridden or removed
4. Report compliance status per profile

Output format:
```
COMPLIANCE CHECK
========================================
Profile: owasp-2025
  [PASS] SQL injection prevention
  [PASS] XSS protection
  [PASS] CSRF token validation
  ...
Status: COMPLIANT (10/10 rules met)
========================================
```

### report

Generate a comprehensive compliance report:

1. Show all profiles (active and inactive)
2. For active profiles, run full compliance check
3. Summarize gaps and recommendations
4. Include remediation steps for any failures
