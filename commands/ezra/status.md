description: Show EZRA governance health — decisions, violations, drift, scan history, and plan status.

You are displaying the EZRA governance status dashboard.

If `.ezra/` does not exist:
```
EZRA STATUS: NOT INITIALIZED
Run /ezra:init to set up governance for this project.
```
Stop here.

## Gather State

Read the following files:
1. `.ezra/governance.yaml` — configuration and rules
2. `.ezra/knowledge.yaml` — codebase knowledge
3. `.ezra/decisions/` — count and categorize all decision files
4. `.ezra/scans/` — find most recent scan, count total scans
5. `.ezra/plans/` — count active plans, check completion status

Project: <name>
Language: <lang> | Framework: <framework>
Architecture: <pattern>
Knowledge Confidence: <INITIAL | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH>

RECENT ACTIVITY
  <last 5 decision records or scan results, most recent first>

RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS
  <based on current state, suggest 1-3 actions>

```

Recommended actions logic:
- No scans ever → "Run /ezra:scan for initial analysis"
- Last scan > 7 days old → "Run /ezra:scan — last scan is stale"
- 0 decisions → "Run /ezra:decide to record architectural decisions"
- Active plans with < 50% completion → "Run /ezra:reconcile to check plan progress"
- Recent scan had CRITICAL findings → "Address <n> critical findings from last scan"

Execute automatically. No confirmation needed.
