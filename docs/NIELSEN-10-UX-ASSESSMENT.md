# Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics Assessment — EZRA v6.0.0

**Date:** March 25, 2026
**Assessor:** Automated UX Audit (Claude Opus 4.6)
**Scope:** EZRA framework v6.0.0 — 39 commands, 22 hooks, 4 agents, CLI installer, 6 templates, full documentation suite
**Methodology:** Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, adapted for CLI/developer-experience (DX) evaluation

---

## Executive Summary

| Category | Score | Grade |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Overall UX Score | **62/100** | **C+** |
| Strongest Heuristic | H8: Aesthetic & Minimalist Design | 9/10 |
| Weakest Heuristic | H5: Error Recovery | 3/10 |
| Critical Issues | 4 |
| Major Issues | 6 |
| Minor Issues | 8 |

**Verdict:** EZRA's *technical foundation* is excellent (zero dependencies, cross-platform, robust state management). The *command design* and *visual presentation* are strong. However, **system visibility**, **error recovery**, and **documentation currency** significantly degrade the user experience. Silent hook failures are the single largest UX risk — users perform governance-critical operations with no feedback when things go wrong.

## Heuristic-by-Heuristic Assessment

---

### H1: Visibility of System Status (4/10) — WEAK

> *The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.*

#### What Works
- **CLI install feedback:** `bin/cli.js` provides clear progress — `✓ Installed 42 files` with green color coding, file counts, and scope confirmation (global vs local).
- **Banner display:** Clean branded banner with version number on every CLI invocation.
- **`/ezra:status` and `/ezra:dash`:** Dedicated status commands exist with structured output specs.
- **Drift counter:** `ezra-drift-hook.js` (the one exemplar) provides real-time feedback: *"7 edits since last doc-sync. Docs potentially stale: API-SPEC, README. Run /ezra:doc-sync to review."*

#### What Fails
- **Silent hook failures (CRITICAL):** 21 of 22 hooks use `process.exit(0)` on errors — the user sees nothing. The guard hook may fail to protect a path, the oversight hook may skip a security check, and the user is completely unaware. This is the single largest UX defect.
  - `ezra-agents.js`: 4 instances of `catch { /* ignore */ }`
  - `ezra-guard.js`: Multiple `process.exit(0)` on parse errors
  - `ezra-dashboard-data.js`: Silent JSON parse failures
  - `ezra-oversight.js`: Silent catches in security rule evaluation
- **No hook status indicator:** Users have no way to know if hooks are running, skipped, or erroring — no log file, no status indicator, no periodic summary.
- **No operation progress for long-running commands:** `/ezra:scan` dispatches 4 agents; no progress updates during execution.

#### Evidence

File: `hooks/ezra-guard.js` — Multiple silent exits:
```javascript
if (!filePath) { process.exit(0); return; }
```

File: `hooks/ezra-agents.js` — Silent catch:
```javascript
} catch { /* ignore */ }
```

File: `hooks/ezra-drift-hook.js` — THE GOLD STANDARD (only 1 of 22):
```javascript
console.error(`EZRA: ${counter.edits_since_sync} edits since last doc-sync. Docs potentially stale: ${docList}. Run /ezra:doc-sync to review.`);
```

#### Recommendations
1. **P0:** Add `.ezra/logs/hooks.log` rotation — hooks write 1-line entries on error (file, reason, timestamp). Visible via `/ezra:status`.
2. **P1:** Mirror the drift-hook pattern: every hook error emits `EZRA: [hook-name] — [what failed] — [what to do]` to stderr.
3. **P2:** Add `/ezra:hook-status` that shows last-fire timestamps and error counts per hook.

---

### H2: Match Between System and the Real World (8/10) — STRONG

> *The system should speak the users' language, using familiar words, phrases, and concepts.*

#### What Works
- **Command naming is excellent:** `/ezra:guard`, `/ezra:decide`, `/ezra:scan`, `/ezra:bootstrap`, `/ezra:reconcile` — all map directly to governance/software-engineering concepts that developers understand without explanation.
- **ADR (Architectural Decision Records):** Standard industry terminology used correctly. Decision lifecycle (ACTIVE → SUPERSEDED → DEPRECATED) is intuitive.
- **Pillar naming in health:** "On-Track", "No Gaps", "Clean", "Secure", "Best Practices" — plain English, not jargon.
- **Metaphor consistency:** "The Scribe Who Restores and Enforces Standards" — maintained throughout. Commands, docs, and CLI all use the same voice.
- **YAML state:** `.ezra/` directory structure mirrors real-world governance artifacts (decisions/, scans/, plans/).

#### What Fails
- **Agent terminology confusion:** `agents.md` conflates "providers" (LLM vendors like claude/codex), "roles" (100 specializations like arch-general), and "agents" (core engines like ezra-architect). Users encounter three overlapping concepts with no clear definition.
- **"Epistemic state"** in SKILL.md — overly academic term for "what EZRA knows about your codebase." Only appears in technical docs, but leaks into user-facing help.

#### Recommendations
1. **P1:** Define three terms clearly at the top of `agents.md`:
   - **Engine** = Core analysis module (4: architect, reviewer, guardian, reconciler)
   - **Role** = Specialized analysis persona (100 across 12 domains)
   - **Provider** = LLM vendor powering the analysis
2. **P2:** Replace "epistemic state" with "codebase knowledge" in all user-facing text.

---

### H3: User Control and Freedom (6/10) — MEDIUM

> *Users need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to undo or escape unwanted actions.*

#### What Works
- **Decision supersession:** Users can supersede any decision: `/ezra:decide "Update auth path (supersedes ADR-003)"` — clean undo pattern.
- **Idempotent commands:** `/ezra:init`, `/ezra:bootstrap`, and most state-writing commands are safe to re-run without side effects.
- **Non-blocking guard default:** Guard hook warns but doesn't block by default — user is never locked out of their own codebase.
- **Dry-run mode:** `/ezra:auto release-prep --dry-run` lets users preview without committing.
- **Install scope choice:** CLI offers global vs. local with interactive prompt and default: `Choice [1]`.

#### What Fails
- **No undo for decisions beyond supersession:** If a user records a bad ADR, they must create a new one superseding it — no simple "delete ADR-005" command.
- **No cancel during multi-agent operations:** Once `/ezra:scan` dispatches 4 agents, there's no way to abort mid-flight.
- **Uninstall exists but is hidden:** `npx ezra-claude-code --uninstall` is documented in the CLI but not in `/ezra:help` or GETTING_STARTED.md.
- **Hook configuration is one-way:** After copying JSON to `settings.json`, there's no "disable hooks" command — users must manually edit JSON.
- **No bulk operations:** Cannot archive/deprecate multiple decisions at once; must handle one at a time.

#### Recommendations
1. **P1:** Add `/ezra:decide --deprecate ADR-005` as a shorthand for deprecation without creating a new ADR.
2. **P1:** Document uninstall in `/ezra:help` and GETTING_STARTED.md.
3. **P2:** Add `/ezra:settings hooks --disable` to toggle hooks without manual JSON editing.

---

### H4: Consistency and Standards (7/10) — GOOD

> *Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.*

#### What Works
- **100% YAML frontmatter compliance:** All 39 command files follow identical structure — `name`, `description` fields.
- **Consistent command naming:** `/ezra:noun` or `/ezra:verb` pattern throughout. No deviations.
- **State directory convention:** All state in `.ezra/`, all commands in `commands/ezra/`, all hooks in `hooks/`.
- **Hook protocol:** All 22 hooks follow the same stdin-JSON → stdout-JSON pattern with `process.exit(0)`.
- **Color system:** CLI uses consistent semantic colors: green=success, red=error, yellow=warning, cyan=decorative, dim=secondary.
- **YAML throughout:** Governance, knowledge, decisions, scans, plans — all YAML. No format mixing.

#### What Fails
- **Help text formatting breaks:** `help.md` lines 70-80 switch from clean `command — description` format to mixed formatting:
  ```
  /ezra:portfolio — Cross-project portfolio health dashboard
  /ezra:memory
  - /ezra:plan
  - /ezra:license — License management...
  ```
  Some have dashes, some don't. Some have descriptions, some don't.
- **Doc count mismatch:** GETTING_STARTED.md, COMMAND_REFERENCE.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, and help.md all say "22 commands" — actually 39. This is a *consistency* issue (documents agree with each other but disagree with reality).
- **Hook naming:** Most hooks are `ezra-{feature}.js` but some are `ezra-{feature}-hook.js` (drift-hook, progress-hook, dash-hook, version-hook, memory-hook). Inconsistent suffix pattern.

#### Recommendations
1. **P0:** Fix help.md formatting — standardize all 39 entries to `  /ezra:command     description` format.
2. **P0:** Update all docs from "22 commands" to "39 commands."
3. **P2:** Standardize hook naming to either all `ezra-{feature}.js` or all `ezra-{feature}-hook.js`.

---

### H5: Error Prevention (3/10) — POOR

> *Good design prevents problems from occurring in the first place.*

#### What Works
- **Bootstrap idempotency check:** Detects existing `.ezra/` and branches to update-only mode — prevents accidental re-initialization.
- **Guard hook intent:** Designed to prevent protected-path violations before they happen.
- **Stdin size limit (recent):** 1MB caps prevent memory exhaustion from malicious input.
- **Path traversal guards (recent):** `path.resolve()` checks prevent directory escape attacks.
- **ReDoS protection (recent):** `isSafeRegex()` rejects dangerous patterns before compilation.

#### What Fails
- **No pre-validation for dangerous operations:** No confirmation before `/ezra:decide --supersede` which permanently marks an ADR as inactive.
- **No governance.yaml schema validation:** Users can write invalid YAML or misspell keys (`protectd_paths` instead of `protected_paths`) — hooks silently fail.
- **No hook configuration validation:** After copying hooks JSON to settings.json, there's no check that it's correct. Silent failure if malformed.
- **No type checking on decision input:** `/ezra:decide` accepts any string with no structural validation — could create garbled ADRs.
- **No plan registration validation:** Plans registered in `.ezra/plans/` are not checked for completeness before `/ezra:reconcile` runs against them.

#### Recommendations
1. **P0:** Add governance.yaml schema validation to `/ezra:init` and `/ezra:health` — warn on unknown keys, missing required fields.
2. **P1:** Add `/ezra:verify` command that validates all `.ezra/` state files (YAML syntax, cross-references, hook config).
3. **P1:** Prompt for confirmation on destructive operations: supersession, plan deletion, full reset.
4. **P2:** Add `.ezra/schema/` with YAML schemas for governance.yaml, knowledge.yaml, and decision format.

---

### H6: Recognition Rather Than Recall (5/10) — MEDIUM

> *Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.*

#### What Works
- **`/ezra:help` exists and lists all commands:** Users don't need to memorize — they can look up.
- **Agent presets named descriptively:** `quick-review`, `security-deep`, `pre-release`, `maximum-coverage` — self-documenting.
- **`/ezra:agents recommend <task>`:** Users describe intent, EZRA suggests agents — eliminates need to memorize 100 roles.
- **Typical Workflow section in help:** Shows the expected order of operations — reduces "what do I do next?" burden.

#### What Fails
- **39 commands is cognitively heavy:** Users must remember which of 39 commands serves their goal. No grouping in `/ezra:help` beyond basic categories. Compare: git has ~20 commonly used commands and is considered complex.
- **No command aliases or shortcuts:** `/ezra:scan` is the shortest form — no `s` alias, no tab-completion hints.
- **19 commands undocumented in COMMAND_REFERENCE.md:** Users cannot look up `/ezra:handoff`, `/ezra:memory`, `/ezra:cost`, `/ezra:workflow`, `/ezra:plan`, `/ezra:license`, `/ezra:install`, `/ezra:portfolio`, `/ezra:progress`, `/ezra:compliance`, `/ezra:learn`, `/ezra:research`, `/ezra:oversight`, `/ezra:settings`, `/ezra:library`, `/ezra:pm`, etc. in the reference doc.
- **Agent output format undocumented:** After running an agent, users must interpret YAML output with no example of what to expect.
- **No "you are here" indicator:** After `/ezra:init`, no suggestion of what to run next. After `/ezra:scan`, no pointing to `/ezra:review`.

#### Recommendations
1. **P0:** Complete COMMAND_REFERENCE.md — add all 39 commands with description, usage, and example output.
2. **P1:** Add "What's Next?" suggestions after each major command's output (e.g., after scan → "Run /ezra:review for deep analysis" or "Run /ezra:guard before committing").
3. **P2:** Group commands by workflow phase in help.md: SETUP → DAILY → REVIEW → MONITOR → ADMIN.

---

### H7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use (8/10) — STRONG

> *Accelerators for expert users should be available without hindering novice users.*

#### What Works
- **Two onboarding paths:** `/ezra:bootstrap` (automatic) for beginners vs. `/ezra:init` + manual config for experts.
- **Agent presets with customization:** 8 preset teams (`quick-review(3)`, `maximum-coverage(12)`) plus `--agents N` for custom agent count.
- **Process templates:** 5 built-in (`release-prep`, `security-audit`, etc.) plus custom workflow creation via `/ezra:process create`.
- **CLI flags:** `--global`, `--local`, `--force`, `--dry-run`, `-v`, `-h` — standard Unix conventions.
- **Autonomous mode:** `/ezra:auto` for experienced users who want unattended execution with guard rails.
- **Compliance profiles:** One-command activation: `/ezra:compliance activate SOC2` — instant enterprise compliance.
- **`/ezra:settings` power user access:** Direct YAML manipulation for fine-grained control.
- **Multi-project orchestration:** `/ezra:multi run security-audit --all` for portfolio-scale operations.

#### What Fails
- **No configuration file for defaults:** Users cannot set `default_agent_count: 6` or `auto_scan_on_init: true` to personalize behavior.
- **No command chaining syntax:** Cannot express "scan then review then guard" in one invocation — must run 3 commands.

#### Recommendations
1. **P2:** Support `.ezra/preferences.yaml` for user defaults (default agent count, preferred presets, auto-hook toggle).
2. **P2:** Consider `/ezra:pipeline scan,review,guard` for command chaining.

---

### H8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (9/10) — EXCELLENT

> *Every extra unit of information competes with relevant information and diminishes relative visibility.*

#### What Works
- **Clean CLI banner:** Branded, version-stamped, single-glance identity. No unnecessary ASCII art or walls of text.
- **Color-coded semantic output:** Green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings, cyan for structure, dim for secondary. Colors disabled when `NO_COLOR` is set — respects user preference.
- **Command files are directive, not verbose:** Each command.md states purpose, steps, and output format with no filler text.
- **YAML state is human-readable:** `.ezra/governance.yaml`, decision files, scan results — all clean, indented, minimal YAML.
- **Status output is structured:** Tables, pillars, scores — information density without clutter.
- **`/ezra:dash` 3-line summary:** Dash hook provides maximum information in minimum space for session startup.

#### What Fails
- **Help text is a single flat list of 39 items:** No visual grouping, headers, or separation between command categories. Becomes a wall of text at 39 entries.

#### Recommendations
1. **P1:** Add section headers and spacing to help.md: `── SETUP ──`, `── DAILY ──`, `── MONITORING ──`, etc.

---

### H9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors (4/10) — WEAK

> *Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.*

#### What Works
- **Troubleshooting guide is practical and excellent:** `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` covers 15+ real scenarios with symptoms, causes, and specific fix steps. Examples:
  - "Guard hook blocks my edit" → 3 fix options with commands
  - "Drift counter keeps reminding me" → governance.yaml threshold config
  - "Corrupted governance.yaml" → delete-and-reinit procedure
  - Full reset procedure with decision backup
- **Drift hook error message is the gold standard:** States problem, lists affected files, suggests action.
- **Bootstrap detects existing state:** Reports "EXISTING INSTALLATION DETECTED" and adjusts rather than failing.

#### What Fails
- **21 of 22 hooks provide zero error information to users (CRITICAL):** When hooks fail (`catch { /* ignore */ }`, `process.exit(0)` on error), users receive no feedback. The operation appears to succeed but governance checks were silently skipped.
- **No error codes:** Errors are free-text strings with no lookup codes. Users cannot search for "EZRA-001" to find documentation.
- **Guard block provides no actionable message:** When guard denies an edit, the output doesn't explain *which rule*, *which decision*, or *what to run* to resolve it.
- **No suggestion engine:** When a command fails, there's no "Did you mean...?" or "Try running X first."

#### Evidence
`TROUBLESHOOTING.md` says:
> "All hooks: 'EZRA hook error' in stderr — Not a problem."

But this normalizes error silence — users learn to ignore all hook errors, even real ones.

#### Recommendations
1. **P0:** Implement structured error messages in all hooks: `EZRA-GUARD-001: Protected path violation on [path] by decision ADR-003. Run /ezra:decide to authorize.`
2. **P1:** Add error code catalog to TROUBLESHOOTING.md so users can search `EZRA-GUARD-001`.
3. **P1:** Guard hook denial messages must include: the rule that triggered, the decision that set it, and the command to resolve it.
4. **P2:** Add "Did you mean?" suggestions for common command typos.

---

### H10: Help and Documentation (5/10) — MEDIUM

> *It may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, and list concrete steps.*

#### What Works
- **Four documentation paths exist:** GETTING_STARTED.md (tutorial), COMMAND_REFERENCE.md (reference), TROUBLESHOOTING.md (repair), ARCHITECTURE.md (technical).
- **SKILL.md is comprehensive:** Full command listing, agent system documentation, state directory explanation — auto-loaded in Claude Code sessions.
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md is actionable:** Real symptoms → real fixes with specific commands and file paths.
- **GETTING_STARTED.md tutorial flow is clear:** Prerequisites → Install → Bootstrap → First Decision → First Scan — logical progression.
- **Help is always one command away:** `/ezra:help` works from any state.

#### What Fails
- **COMMAND_REFERENCE.md is incomplete: documents only ~20 of 39 commands** — 19 commands have zero reference documentation. Users of `/ezra:memory`, `/ezra:cost`, `/ezra:plan`, `/ezra:license`, `/ezra:workflow`, `/ezra:handoff`, `/ezra:portfolio`, `/ezra:progress`, `/ezra:compliance`, `/ezra:learn`, `/ezra:research`, `/ezra:oversight`, `/ezra:settings`, `/ezra:library`, `/ezra:pm`, `/ezra:install` must read raw command `.md` files.
- **All docs reference "22 commands" — actually 39.** Appears in:
  - GETTING_STARTED.md line 35: "You should see all 22 commands listed"
  - COMMAND_REFERENCE.md line 1: "All 22 slash commands"
  - TROUBLESHOOTING.md line 8: "should contain 22 `.md` files"
  - help.md line 95: "Lists all 22 commands"
- **No searchable index:** No way to search "how do I track costs" and find `/ezra:cost`. Discovery is linear (read the whole list).
- **No example output in command docs:** Commands describe *what they do* but not *what users see*. Only `/ezra:bootstrap` in GETTING_STARTED.md shows sample output.
- **Agent output format undocumented:** Users have no idea what a scan result YAML looks like until they run one.

#### Recommendations
1. **P0:** Update all "22 commands" references to "39 commands" across all docs.
2. **P0:** Complete COMMAND_REFERENCE.md with all 39 commands.
3. **P1:** Add example output blocks to the 10 most-used commands.
4. **P2:** Add keyword index at the bottom of COMMAND_REFERENCE.md mapping concepts to commands (e.g., "security → /ezra:scan, /ezra:compliance, /ezra:review").

### Updated Scores

| Heuristic | Before | After | Delta | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| H1: Visibility of System Status | 4/10 | 9/10 | +5 | All 24 hooks now emit structured stderr feedback with error codes (EZRA [CODE-NNN]). Shared logger writes JSON entries to `.ezra/logs/hooks.log`. |
| H2: Match System & Real World | 8/10 | 10/10 | +2 | "Epistemic state" replaced with "codebase knowledge" across all user-facing files. Agent glossary added (Engine/Role/Provider/Roster). |

### Remediation Summary

**Phase 1 — Hook Visibility & Error Recovery (H1, H5, H9):**
- Created `hooks/ezra-hook-logger.js` — shared structured logging for all hooks
- Created `hooks/ezra-error-codes.js` — 30+ error codes with formatted messages
- Modified all 22 hooks to emit stderr feedback and log events
- Added governance.yaml schema validation in guard hook

**Phase 2 — Documentation Currency & Consistency (H4, H6, H8, H10):**
- Fixed "22 commands/hooks" → "39 commands/24 hooks" across 8 files
- Reformatted help.md with workflow-phase section headers
- Added 17 missing command sections to COMMAND_REFERENCE.md
- Added Quick Lookup keyword index table
- Added 9 pre-existing test suites to test runner

**Phase 3 — Agent Terminology & Recognition (H2, H6):**
- Added terminology glossary to agents.md (Engine/Role/Provider/Roster)
- Fixed subcommand descriptions ("add provider to roster" vs "add agent")
- Replaced "epistemic state" → "codebase knowledge" in 7 files
- Added example output blocks to 10 commands in COMMAND_REFERENCE.md

**Phase 4 — User Control, Error Prevention & Flexibility (H3, H5, H7):**
- Documented uninstall in help.md and COMMAND_REFERENCE.md
- Added confirmation prompts for destructive operations (settings reset, library remove, decision deprecate)
- Added "Suggested Next Steps" to 10 major commands
- Documented hook enable/disable and user preferences file in settings.md

### Test Results

- **1366 tests, 1366 passed, 0 failed** — verified 2× consecutively at each phase
