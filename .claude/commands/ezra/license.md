### deactivate
Deactivate current license and revert to Core tier.

## Tiers

| Tier | Price | Key Required |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Core | Free | No |
| Pro | $29/user/mo | Yes |
| Team | $59/user/mo | Yes |
| Enterprise | Custom | Yes |

## Notes
- Core tier is free forever — no license check, no phone-home, no telemetry.
- Pro/Team validation uses a local cache (30-day expiry).
- Actual validation is handled by ezra-cloud (separate service).
