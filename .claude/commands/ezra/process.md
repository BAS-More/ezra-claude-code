You are managing the EZRA Process Engine — the system for creating, running, and managing repeatable development workflows.

If `.ezra/` does not exist, tell the user to run `/ezra:init` first and stop.

## ACTION: create <name> — Interactive Process Builder

Walk the user through building a process:

1. Ask: "What does this process do?" → Set `description`
2. Ask: "How many steps?" or "Describe your steps and I'll structure them."
3. For each step, determine:
   - Name and description
   - Type (command, ezra, script, check, approval, report)
   - The actual action
   - Failure handling (stop, skip, retry, ask)
4. Ask about guard rails: "What conditions must be true before running?"
5. Ask about triggers: "Should this run manually, on schedule, or on events?"
6. Write the process file
7. Confirm: "✅ Process '<name>' created with <n> steps."

If the user provides a plain-text description like:
```
step 1) run gap analysis
step 2) bridge all findings
step 3) run bug test
step 4) execute report
```

Parse this automatically into structured steps:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: 1
    name: Gap Analysis
    type: ezra
    ezra_command: doc-check
    on_failure: stop
    
  - id: 2
    name: Bridge Findings
    description: Address all gaps identified in step 1
    type: ezra
    ezra_command: doc create
    ezra_args: <dynamically determined from step 1 output>
    on_failure: ask
    
  - id: 3
    name: Bug Test
    type: command
    command: npm test
    on_failure: stop
    
  - id: 4
    name: Generate Report
    type: report
    report_type: detailed
    report_sources: [steps.1, steps.2, steps.3]
    on_failure: skip
```

## ACTION: run <name> — Execute Process (Interactive)

1. Load the process definition
2. Check ALL guard rails first:
   ```
   EZRA PROCESS — <name>
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════
   Guard Rail Check:
     ✅ Clean git: yes
     ✅ Tests passing: yes
     ❌ Health score ≥ 50: FAIL (current: 38)
   
   Guard rail failed. Cannot proceed.
   Fix: Run /ezra:health and address critical items.
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════
   ```
3. If guards pass, execute steps sequentially:
   ```
   EZRA PROCESS — <name>
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════
   Step 1/4: Gap Analysis
   Running: /ezra:doc-check
   ...
   ✅ Step 1 complete. 3 gaps identified.
   
   Step 2/4: Bridge Findings
   Running: /ezra:doc create deploy-runbook
   ...
   ✅ Step 2 complete. 3 documents created.
   
   Step 3/4: Bug Test
   Running: npm test
   ...
   ❌ Step 3 FAILED. 2 tests failing.
   Action: [R]etry / [S]kip / [A]bort?
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════
   ```
4. After completion (or abort), generate execution report
5. Save run to `.ezra/processes/runs/<name>-<ISO>.yaml`

## ACTION: edit <name> — Modify Process

1. Load the existing process
2. Present current steps as a numbered list
3. Ask: "What do you want to change?"
   - "Add step after step 3"
   - "Remove step 5"
   - "Change step 2 to run /ezra:scan instead"
   - "Reorder steps 3 and 4"
   - "Change guard rail: require health ≥ 60"
4. Apply changes, bump process version
5. Confirm changes

## ACTION: template save <name> — Save as Template

1. Read the process definition
2. Strip project-specific details (paths, specific file names)
3. Generalize commands where possible
4. Save to `.ezra/processes/templates/<name>.yaml`
5. Add metadata: `template: true`, `portable: true`
6. Confirm: "✅ Template '<name>' saved. Can be loaded in any project."

## Rules

- Process definitions are YAML — human-readable, version-controlled, shareable.
- Built-in templates are created on `/ezra:init` but can be customized.
- Every run is persisted. History is never lost.
- Guard rails are checked BEFORE the first step. If guards fail, the process doesn't start.
- In interactive mode, failed steps always ask the user what to do.
- In `--auto` mode, failed steps follow the `on_failure` setting (see /ezra:auto).
- Processes can reference output from previous steps via `output_variable`.
