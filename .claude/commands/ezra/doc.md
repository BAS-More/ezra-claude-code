You are managing the EZRA document registry — the central index of all project documents across the full SDLC lifecycle.

Read `.ezra/docs/registry.yaml` to understand current state. If it doesn't exist, create it using the template below.

## Argument Parsing

Parse $ARGUMENTS to determine the action:

- `/ezra:doc create <type>` → Create a new document of the specified type
- `/ezra:doc update <type>` → Update an existing document
- `/ezra:doc list` → List all documents with status
- `/ezra:doc list <phase>` → List documents for a specific phase (pre-dev, dev, post-dev)
- `/ezra:doc status` → Document health report (coverage, staleness, gaps)
- `/ezra:doc check` → Check which documents are missing for current project phase
- `/ezra:doc` (no args) → Show help

## ACTION: create <type>

When creating a document:

1. Look up the document type from the registry above
2. Create the document file at `.ezra/docs/<phase>/<type-id>.md`
3. Use the appropriate template (see Templates section below)
4. Register it in `.ezra/docs/registry.yaml`
5. Report what was created

### Document File Template

Every document starts with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: <type-id>
title: <Document Title>
phase: pre-dev | dev | post-dev
category: <category name>
criticality: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
status: DRAFT | IN_REVIEW | APPROVED | CURRENT | STALE | SUPERSEDED
version: 1.0
created: <ISO date>
updated: <ISO date>
author: <who created it>
reviewer: <who approved it, if applicable>
linked_decisions: []  # ADR IDs this doc relates to
linked_risks: []      # Risk IDs this doc relates to
---

# <Document Title>

## Purpose
<Why this document exists and who it's for>

## Content
<The actual document content — EZRA generates initial content
based on codebase analysis and existing .ezra/ state>

## Change History
| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0 | <date> | EZRA | Initial creation |
```

When creating, EZRA should:
- Pre-populate content by analyzing the codebase and existing `.ezra/` state
- For `tad`, read `.ezra/knowledge.yaml` and expand into full architecture doc
- For `adr`, aggregate all `.ezra/decisions/` into a formatted ADR log
- For `risk-register`, aggregate all `.ezra/` risk data
- For `api-spec`, scan route files and generate OpenAPI-style documentation
- For `data-model`, scan schema/migration files and generate ERD descriptions
- For `test-strategy`, scan test config files and document the approach
- For `coding-standards`, read linter configs, tsconfig, and document rules
- For `deploy-runbook`, read CI/CD configs, Dockerfiles, and document steps

Always generate real content from the codebase — never create empty placeholder docs.

## ACTION: update <type>

1. Find the existing document in `.ezra/docs/`
2. Re-analyze the codebase for any changes relevant to this document type
3. Update the document content, bump version, update timestamp
4. Mark any sections that changed with `<!-- UPDATED <date> -->`
5. Update `registry.yaml`

## ACTION: list / list <phase>

Read `registry.yaml` and present:

```

CRITICAL GAPS (documents you need NOW):
  ❌ <type> — <title> — <why it's needed for current phase>

STALE DOCUMENTS (not updated in 30+ days):

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. <most important doc to create next>
  2. <next>
  3. <next>
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## ACTION: check

Intelligent gap analysis based on project phase:

1. Read `.ezra/governance.yaml` to determine current project phase
2. Identify which documents are required/recommended for that phase
3. Check which exist and which are missing
4. Present a prioritized list of what to create next

## Registry File Format

`.ezra/docs/registry.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1
last_updated: <ISO>
project_phase: pre-dev | dev | post-dev

documents:
  - id: prd

Execute automatically. Generate real content from the codebase. Never create empty placeholder documents.
