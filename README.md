# EZRA (עזרא)

## The Scribe Who Restores and Enforces Standards

> *"And Ezra had set his heart to seek the Torah of Hashem, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statute and ordinance."* — Ezra 7:10

EZRA is a multi-agent codebase governance framework for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). It provides 39 slash commands, 4 subagent engines with 100 specialized roles, 24 lifecycle hooks, 55 SDLC document types, 5-pillar health enforcement, autonomous process execution with guard rails, and multi-project portfolio orchestration.

### Identity

**Ezra HaSofer (עזרא הסופר)** — Ezra the Scribe — returned from Babylonian exile to find Israel's standards broken, its governance collapsed, and its practices drifted from what was decreed. He didn't just rebuild. He audited. He documented. He enforced.

What Ezra did for Israel, this system does for codebases:

- **Restored the standard** — Ezra re-established the Torah as the authoritative source of truth. EZRA establishes architectural decisions, coding standards, and governance rules as the authoritative source for your project.
- **Audited compliance** — Ezra conducted a public audit of the people's adherence to the law. EZRA scans your codebase against recorded decisions, protected paths, and configured standards.
- **Documented everything** — Ezra was a Sofer (scribe) — the original documentation specialist. He ensured the text was accurate, complete, and accessible. EZRA manages 55 SDLC document types across the full project lifecycle.
- **Enforced with authority** — Ezra didn't suggest. He governed. When he found violations, he required correction. EZRA's guard rails halt autonomous execution the moment a violation is detected.
- **Taught and elevated** — Ezra didn't just enforce — he taught the people to understand the standards themselves. EZRA's advisor provides lifecycle-aware guidance, best practices, and forward-looking recommendations.

The name EZRA encodes the system's purpose: **Enforce. Zero-drift. Restore. Audit.**

Works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

## Health Pillars

`/ezra:health` scores your project across 5 weighted pillars:

| Pillar | Weight | Checks |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **On-Track** | 25% | Plans progressing, decisions recorded, recent scans, no stalled work |
| **No Gaps** | 20% | Document coverage, test coverage, API docs, decision coverage |
| **Clean** | 15% | No `any` types, strict TypeScript, linting, no dead code |
| **Secure** | 25% | OWASP compliance, npm audit, auth, secrets, rate limiting |
| **Best Practices** | 15% | CI/CD, SOLID, error handling, git hygiene, structured logging |

Grades: **A** (90+), **B** (75-89), **C** (60-74), **D** (40-59), **F** (0-39)

## Process Templates

EZRA ships with 5 built-in process templates:

| Template | Steps | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `full-remediation` | 8 | Gap analysis, health, docs, tests, security, report |
| `release-prep` | 6 | Health gate, security audit, doc check, reconcile |
| `sprint-close` | 5 | Tests, scan, doc sync, reconcile, snapshot |
| `security-audit` | 7 | OWASP scan, dep audit, secrets check, report |
| `onboarding` | 4 | Init, scan, doc check, advisor |

Create custom processes from plain English:

```
/ezra:process create my-flow

> step 1: run gap analysis
> step 2: bridge all findings
> step 3: run tests
> step 4: generate report
```

Save as template: `/ezra:process template save my-flow`

## Autonomous Execution

```
/ezra:auto full-remediation
```

Runs all steps without manual intervention. Guard rails enforce:

- Clean git, passing tests, minimum health score
- **Never** touches `.env`, secrets, `main` branch, production
- **Blocks** `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, `git push --force`
- Re-checks guards **before and after every step**
- Halts immediately on any violation with specific remediation

## Project State

EZRA persists all state in `.ezra/` at the project root:

```
.ezra/
├── decisions/      # Architectural Decision Records
├── scans/          # Scan + health results
├── plans/          # Plans for reconciliation
├── docs/           # 55-type SDLC document library + proposals
├── processes/      # Workflow definitions + templates + run history
├── versions/       # Immutable changelog + snapshots
├── governance.yaml # Rules, protected paths, enforcement
└── knowledge.yaml  # Codebase knowledge
```
